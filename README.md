A Python script for encoding data into images.

This is a tool that uses Python to encode arbitrary data into PNG images or decode data back from PNG images. The script utilizes the Zstandard compression algorithm to improve data compression ratios.

This repository contains the following:

1. [data2img.py script](data2img.py): A script for encoding data into images or decoding data back from images.
2. [code.png](code.png): A PNG image of the code.
3. [demo.mp4](demo.mp4): A demonstration video.

## Dependencies

This project runs on [Python 3](https://www.python.org/). Please ensure you have Python 3 and the following dependencies installed locally:

- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (for handling images)
- [pyzstd](https://pypi.org/project/pyzstd/) (for compressing and decompressing data)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) (for displaying progress bars)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```sh
$ pip install Pillow pyzstd tqdm
```

## Usage Instructions

### Encode

Encode data into an image, where the data source can be a file or text.
Encoding from a file into an image:

```bash
python data2img.py -e <file_path> [-o <output_image_file_path>] [-s]
```

Encoding from text into an image:

```bash
python data2img.py -t <text> [-o <output_image_file_path>] [-s]
```

If no output file path is specified, it defaults to out.png in the current directory.

If the -s parameter is used, the image file will automatically open upon completion of encoding.

### Decode

Decode an image back into data.

Decoding from a local image file:

```bash
python data2img.py -d <image_file_path> [-o <output_data_file_path>]
```

Decoding from a Data URI scheme:

```bash
python data2img.py -u <Data_URI_scheme> [-o <output_data_file_path>]
```

If no output file path is specified, it defaults to a .out file with the same name as the input file.

### Print

Print the result directly to the terminal.

Printing the encoded Data URI scheme:

```bash
python data2img.py -e <file_path> -p
```

Printing the decoded data:

```bash
python data2img.py -d <image_file_path> -p
```

If the decoded data is text, it will attempt to print it in UTF-8 encoding. If this fails, it will print the Base64 encoded string.
